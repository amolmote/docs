# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 0.3.0
*Release Date August 2022*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries which allow pods and services to communicate seamlessly across clusters, clouds, edges, and data centres. 

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## Whatâ€™s New

These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.

## Custom QoS Profile
KubeSlice supports a new QoS profile configuration in a separate YAML file. 
The QoS profile must be applied and called out as a standard QoS profile in 
a slice configuration. This is useful when you want to configure the same 
QoS profile on multiple slices.

Google Kubernetes Engine, and KIND Kubernetes clusters.
